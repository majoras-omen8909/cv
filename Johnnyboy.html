  <p>I am a graduate of psychology BA from Weber State University. I entered the clinical field for over 6 years, and found that I
    despised it entirely. I now work for my family's old custodial company, and practice coding on the side in hopes of a
    new career, an app for my rubichess idea, the ability to code various game ideas that I have, and to start up a new social
    media website that allows greater catigorization for the user base, creating greater freedom and giving less power to a
    few individuals.</p>
